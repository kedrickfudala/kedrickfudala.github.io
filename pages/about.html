<p>I'm Kedrick! <i>(he/him)</i></p>

<p>I'm a recent UVA graduate with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a minor in Studio Art.</p>
<p>I like working at the intersection of code, design, and experimentation!

<p>I'm a game designer and developer, and I use technologies like Unity and Godot to bring my visions to life.</p>
<p>I wear many hats in development and find myself doing prototyping, system design and implementation, testing and polishing, and steering the creative process.</p>

<p>
    You find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kedrick-fudala/" target="_blank">linkedin</a> if you want to connect,
    and most of my game projects are <u>available to play in browser</u> on my <a href="https://kedrickfudala.itch.io" target="_blank">itch.io</a> page!
